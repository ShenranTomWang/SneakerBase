## Timeline & Milestones
Complete backend design before Nov 18th. For each page of the front end we have noted down the corresponding SQL quary that needs to be constructed in the backend of this project. 

The SQL Query will take an approximate time of completion of 4-5 SQL Queries per week, with 13 queries on our TODO list, this schedule will meet our deadline by the 3rd week of November to complete the backend design. This section of work will be evenly shared among all three memebers. 
Note: We have pinned the TODO list in each of the pages with their corresponding frontend application.

With the SQL query completed, we aim to populate the database by the following week, while testing out the query design.
This should be done by around November 20th. This share of work will be Frank Han's responsibility.

The next five days until the final deadline for the project, Tom Wang and Eric Chu will be connecting the frontend design with the completed and populated SQL query. While Frank will be doing the final testing of checking if the data extracted from the query is correct.
